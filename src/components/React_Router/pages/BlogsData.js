      title: 'Getting Started with React',
      body: `React is a powerful JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. It lets developers create large web applications that can update and render efficiently in response to data changes. React follows a component-based architecture, which makes the code more modular and easier to maintain. One of its core features is the virtual DOM, which improves performance by minimizing direct manipulation of the real DOM. React is maintained by Facebook and a large community of developers.`

      title: 'Understanding JavaScript Closures',
      body: `Closures are a fundamental concept in JavaScript. A closure is created when a function is defined inside another function and gains access to its parent’s variables. Even after the parent function has finished execution, the inner function remembers the variables from the parent scope. This is useful for data privacy and function factories. For example, closures allow us to create private variables in JavaScript and write more modular and reusable code.`

      title: 'Tips for Writing Clean Code',
      body: `Clean code is not just about making your code look good. It’s about writing code that is easy to read, maintain, and extend. Always use meaningful variable and function names, avoid deep nesting, and keep functions small and focused on a single task. Use consistent formatting and add comments where necessary. Writing clean code reduces the chance of bugs and helps new developers quickly understand the codebase. Think of it like writing a story that other developers can read easily.`

      title: 'Why Learn Node.js?',
      body: `Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side. It uses the V8 engine and is known for its speed and efficiency, particularly in handling I/O operations. With Node.js, you can build scalable and performant web applications with real-time features like chat apps or live streaming. Its non-blocking, event-driven architecture makes it ideal for applications that handle a lot of concurrent connections. Node.js is also backed by npm, a huge package ecosystem.`

      title: 'What is MongoDB?',
      body: `MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database used for high-volume data storage. It stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, meaning fields can vary from document to document and data structure can be changed over time. This makes it a great fit for projects that require rapid development and flexibility. MongoDB supports indexing, replication, and powerful querying, and it integrates well with JavaScript-based tech stacks like MERN and MEAN.`
