      title: 'React',
      body: `React is a powerful JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. It lets developers create large web applications that can update and render efficiently in response to data changes. React follows a component-based architecture, which makes the code more modular and easier to maintain. One of its core features is the virtual DOM, which improves performance by minimizing direct manipulation of the real DOM. React is maintained by Facebook and a large community of developers.`

      title: 'Closures',
      body: `Closures are a fundamental concept in JavaScript. A closure is created when a function is defined inside another function and gains access to its parent’s variables. Even after the parent function has finished execution, the inner function remembers the variables from the parent scope. This is useful for data privacy and function factories. For example, closures allow us to create private variables in JavaScript and write more modular and reusable code.`

      title: 'WritingCleanCode',
      body: `Clean code is not just about making your code look good. It’s about writing code that is easy to read, maintain, and extend. Always use meaningful variable and function names, avoid deep nesting, and keep functions small and focused on a single task. Use consistent formatting and add comments where necessary. Writing clean code reduces the chance of bugs and helps new developers quickly understand the codebase. Think of it like writing a story that other developers can read easily.`
